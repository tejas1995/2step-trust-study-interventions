        "option1": "Consumers at the top level require more energy than the lower-level consumers.",
        "option2": "The consumers are feeding on smaller organisms that have less energy.",

        "ai_confidence": "70%",
        "ai_is_correct": true,
        "ai_explanation": "Consumers at the top level of a food pyramid generally require more energy to sustain themselves due to their higher metabolic rates and larger body sizes. This means they need to consume a larger quantity of lower-level organisms to meet their energy needs. As a result, there are fewer organisms at each successive trophic level as energy is lost and transferred up the food chain."
